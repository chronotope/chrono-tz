//! Rust library for reading the text files comprising the [zoneinfo
//! database][w], which records time zone changes and offsets across the world
//! from multiple sources.
//!
//! The zoneinfo database is distributed in one of two formats: a raw text
//! format with one file per continent, and a compiled binary format with one
//! file per time zone. This crate deals with the former; for the latter, see
//! the [`zoneinfo_compiled` crate][zc] instead.
//!
//! The database itself is maintained by IANA. For more information, see
//! [IANAâ€™s page on the time zone database][iana]. You can also find the text
//! files themselves in [the tz repository][tz].

//!
//! ## Outline
//!
//! Reading a zoneinfo text file is split into three stages:
//!
//! - **Parsing** individual lines of text into `Lines` is done by the `line`
//!   module;
//! - **Interpreting** these lines into a complete `Table` is done by the
//!   `table` module;
//! - **Calculating transitions** from this table is done by the `transitions`
//!   module.
